# Assembly Guide

This guide describes how to assemble **PrintExo** from 3D-printed components, off-the-shelf mechanical parts, and electronics.

---

## 1. Overview

PrintExo uses a modular architecture organized into three main subsystems:

| Subsystem | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Actuation module | Motor, planetary gear stage, protective casing |
| Shank structure | Vertical frame, passive hinge, calf attachment |
| Shoe interface | Dorsal component, plantar guides, lace integration |

Assembly follows a bottom-up approach: gearbox → actuation module → shank → shoe interface.

## 2. Before You Begin

### Checklist

- [ ] All 3D-printed parts completed and post-processed
- [ ] All BOM components available (bearings, fasteners, motor)
- [ ] Required tools prepared
- [ ] Clean, well-lit workspace

### Recommended Preparation

1. **Verify printed parts** — check for warping, incomplete features, or layer defects
2. **Ream all holes** — use appropriate drill bits to clean up M3 holes
3. **Tap threads** — tap M3 holes where bolts will be inserted
4. **Dry-fit bearings** — ensure press-fit is snug but not cracked

---

## 3. Required Tools

| Tool | Size/Spec | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Hex key set | 2.5 mm (for M3) | Tightening bolts |
| Screwdriver | Phillips / Flat | General fastening |
| Drill bits | 2.5 mm, 3.0 mm | Hole reaming |
| Hand tap | M3 × 0.5 | Threading holes |
| Needle-nose pliers | — | Support removal, small parts |
| Calipers | — | Dimensional verification |
| Power drill (optional) | — | Speeds up drilling/tapping |

## 5. Alignment & Fit Verification

After assembly, perform the following checks:

### Mechanical Checks

| Check | Expected Result |
|-------|-----------------|
| Gearbox rotation | Smooth, no grinding or binding |
| Hinge movement | Free inversion/eversion motion |
| Motor operation | Spins without obstruction |
| Shoe interface rigidity | No wobble at mounting point |

### Fit Checks

- [ ] Shank aligned with lateral side of lower leg
- [ ] Ankle joint axis approximately aligned with device axis
- [ ] Calf sleeve secure while comfortable
- [ ] Laces tensioned evenly across dorsal interface
- [ ] No pinch points during range of motion test

---

## 6. Safety Notes

- **Do not over-tighten** M3 bolts — PLA can crack under excessive torque
- **Inspect all structural joints** before human testing
- **Check for pinch points** around hinge and gearbox
