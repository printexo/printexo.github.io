# Shoelace Fixation Guide

This guide describes how to **mount the dorsal interface onto the shoe** and **secure it using auxiliary shoelaces** for PrintExo.

---

## 1. Overview

The shoelace fixation method provides a **non-invasive, shoe-agnostic interface** that allows PrintExo to be mounted on standard lace-up footwear without permanent modification.

This guide covers:
- mounting the dorsal interface onto the shoe,
- routing and tensioning shoelaces for secure fixation.

---

## 2. Before You Begin

### Checklist

- [ ] PrintExo assembly completed up to **Assembly Guide – Step 21**
- [ ] Dorsal interface prepared
- [ ] Auxiliary shoelaces prepared
- [ ] Lace-up shoe selected (standard eyelets)

## 3. Dorsal Interface Fixation Steps

---

### Step 1 — Prepare the Shoe

Loosen and remove the original shoelaces to expose the shoe tongue.

### Step 5 — Fasten the Carrier to the Dorsal Interface

This step is identical to **Step 22 of the Assembly Guide**.  
For clarity, only the **Carrier** is shown here; the rest of the PrintExo assembly is omitted.
