# Build the Robot

This section walks you through how to **physically build PrintExo** — from parts sourcing to 3D printing and final assembly.

PrintExo is designed to be:
- **FDM-printable** using consumer desktop 3D printers,
- **off-the-shelf friendly** with standard, easily sourced hardware,
- **shoe-agnostic**, requiring no permanent modification to footwear.
