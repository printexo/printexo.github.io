## General

### What is PrintExo?
PrintExo is an open-source, 3D-printable ankle exoskeleton designed to lower the barriers to wearable robotics research and education. It uses consumer-grade FDM printers and standard off-the-shelf components.

### Who developed PrintExo?
PrintExo was developed by the **Movement Intelligence Laboratory (MINT Lab)** at Korea University.

### Is PrintExo free to use?
Yes. PrintExo is open-source. All CAD files, documentation, and software are freely available.

## Hardware

### What 3D printer do I need?
Any consumer-grade FDM 3D printer. We recommend the Bambu Lab X1C, but other printers work as well.

### What material should I use?
**PLA** is recommended for ease of printing. PETG or carbon-fiber–reinforced filaments are also compatible for improved durability.

### How long does it take to print all parts?
Approximately **2 days per leg** (1 day 23 hours 51 minutes) with 70% gyroid infill and supports.

### How much filament do I need?
About **950 g per leg** (model + supports).

### What motor does PrintExo use?
CubeMars AK60-6 V1.1 KV140 actuator with integrated driver.

## Assembly

### What tools do I need?
- Hex key set (2.5 mm for M3)
- Screwdriver
- Drill bits (2.5 mm, 3.0 mm)
- M3 hand tap
- Calipers
- Needle-nose pliers

### How long does assembly take?
Approximately 2–4 hours for a first-time builder, less with experience.

### Do I need special skills?
Basic mechanical assembly skills are sufficient. No machining or specialized equipment required.

## Usage

### What shoes can I use with PrintExo?
Any lace-up shoe. The shoe interface is designed to be **shoe-agnostic** and attaches through standard shoelaces.

### Is PrintExo safe to wear?
PrintExo is a research platform. Always perform bench testing before human trials, start with zero-torque mode, and follow all safety guidelines in the documentation.

### Can I modify the design?
Yes. Editable CAD files (.f3d) are provided. We encourage modifications and improvements.
