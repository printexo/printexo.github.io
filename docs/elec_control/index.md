# Electronics & Control

This section will be updated in future releases to provide **example electronics and control implementations** used with PrintExo.

The content is intended as a **reference use case**, rather than a prescriptive or required control setup.  
Alternative electronics configurations and control strategies may be used depending on research goals.

Planned example topics include:

- electronics overview  
- motor driver setup and configuration  
- control software structure  
- running a full walking demo  

Details will be added as example implementations are documented.
