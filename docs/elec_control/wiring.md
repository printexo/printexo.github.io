## 1. Purpose of This Page

This page describes **how the electrical components are physically connected**, including:

- power wiring  
- motor driver connections  
- sensor wiring  
- communication cables  

It focuses on **hardware connections only**, not software configuration.

---

## 2. Wiring Overview (Placeholder)

_Add a short description here of the overall wiring concept, such as:_

- centralized vs distributed wiring
- locations of major connectors
- fixed vs detachable cables

You may later insert a schematic or photo.

---

## 3. Wiring Diagram (Placeholder)

_Leave space here for a future block or schematic diagram._

> Example items you may include later:
- full wiring schematic
- connector labels
- pinout tables
- cable routing map

## 5. Cable & Connector Guidelines

_Add content such as:_

- connector types  
- recommended cable gauge  
- insulation type  
- strain relief methods  
- routing along the frame

## 6. Power Distribution Notes

_Placeholder reminders:_

- battery or external supply selection  
- grounding strategy  
- fuse or breaker placement  
- overcurrent protection  

---

## 7. Safety Considerations

_Placeholder checklist:_

- avoid exposed conductive surfaces  
- secure wires away from moving parts  
- protect cables from sharp edges  
- verify polarity before powering on
