Wearable ankle exoskeletons are a key testbed for assistive control and human-robot interaction during locomotion, but many systems remain difficult to build and deploy due to fabrication and fitting overhead (e.g., CNC/composite processes, long lead times, and shoe-specific interfaces).

We present PrintExo, an open-source, shoe-agnostic, fully 3D-printable ankle exoskeleton platform designed to lower the barrier to early-stage locomotion research and rapid prototyping. PrintExo can be fabricated using consumer-grade FDM printing and standard off-the-shelf components, and integrates a compact 3D-printed 1:4 planetary gearbox for ankle assistance (total assembled mass: 1.33 kg per leg, excluding the user’s shoe).

A lace-anchored shoe interface transmits torque through commercially available lace-up footwear without permanent modification, enabling fast fitting across participants.

The device was evaluated in a pilot treadmill study with five able-bodied participants walking at 1.0 m/s under three conditions: no-device, zero-torque, and powered assistance. Across completed sessions, powered assistance reduced metabolic cost relative to zero-torque, and encoder-derived kinematics captured device-side ankle motion during torque application.

Overall, PrintExo provides a practical, low-overhead, open-source platform for accessible ankle-exoskeleton prototyping and pilot locomotion experiments.
