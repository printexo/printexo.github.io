## ⭐️ Key Features

- **Fully 3D-printable structural components**  
  manufacturable with consumer-grade FDM printers

- **Shoe-agnostic interface**  
  attaches through standard shoelaces — no permanent footwear modification required

- **Off-the-shelf hardware only**  
  no machining, no custom metal parts

- **Modular architecture**  
  supports rapid prototyping of assistance strategies

- **Open CAD, STL, and G-code provided**  
  ready for direct fabrication

- **Validated on human walking**  
  pilot study demonstrates mechanical and metabolic feasibility

## 🧭 What is PrintExo?

PrintExo is a lightweight ankle exoskeleton intended for:

- locomotion biomechanics research  
- exoskeleton control algorithm development  
- undergraduate and graduate education  
- rapid prototyping in new laboratories  
- hands-on wearable robotics training workshops

Unlike many existing systems that require:

- CNC machining  
- carbon-fiber layups  
- custom instrumented shoes  

PrintExo can be built using:

- a desktop FDM 3D printer  
- commonly available fasteners  
- a commercially available actuator  
- any standard lace-up shoe

## 🛠 System Overview

PrintExo consists of:

- **Actuation module**
    - AK60-6 actuator with integrated driver
    - 1:4 3D-printed planetary gearbox

- **Shank frame**
    - laterally mounted structure
    - passive hinge for inversion/eversion

- **Shoe interface**
    - lace-integrated dorsal anchor
    - auxiliary plantar lacing

- **Electronics & control**
    - simple, open control pipeline
    - support for basic walking assistance demos
